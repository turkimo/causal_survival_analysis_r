# Causal survival analysis with applications in R course at SFDA 

This github page will include everything about the course including the background papaer, dataset, presentations and practicals. 

The workshop aims to introduce causal survival analysis of clinical data and will be in two parts. The first part will be an introductory part and will cover basic concpets and terminology, non-parametric methods and tests and semi-parametric regression based models. All of these will only focus on the analysis of fixed treatments and baseline covarites and will not cover time-varying treatments of confounders.
